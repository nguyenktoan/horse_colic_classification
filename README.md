# Horse Colic Disease Classification

This project focuses on the classification of horse colic diseases using the **Horse Colic Dataset**. Colic is a common and potentially life-threatening condition in horses, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. By applying machine learning models to this dataset, the goal is to predict whether a horse is at risk based on various medical and physiological indicators.

## Dataset

The **Horse Colic Dataset** contains information on 368 horses with features such as:

- Age, pulse, respiration, temperature
- Specific medical observations like mucous membranes, capillary refill time
- Diagnosis of surgical lesions and other pathological outcomes

Each record is categorized into a target variable indicating whether the horse survived, required surgery, or died due to colic.

## Project Goals

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize or scale features, and perform feature selection.
- **Model Development:** Train and evaluate machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to classify disease outcomes.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC will be used to assess model performance.
- **Deployment:** Potential deployment of a prediction system for use in veterinary practices.
